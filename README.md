# alpineAnimalVet
Alpine Animal Vet is a project I worked on for a college class. The class is CS 3660 (Web programming 2). We did alot of work with frontend
technologies, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap and more. We went further and set up a database for storing all the owner and pet 
information. The then wired up a backend in PHP to query that mySQL database and provide the data on the client.
